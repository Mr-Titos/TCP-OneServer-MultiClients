# TCP-OneServer-MultiClients

This program is a test to create a chat with one server and a lots of clients
This is a console program so I dont have secure this code, its really the minimum for the chat (but its works :p), I think it's better for you to understand :)

If you want to launch it on Visual Studio don't forget to activate the start with multi-solutions
(Right click on the solution and click on properties, then activate multi project start and configure on Start all solutions you need)
